  Release to Test PyPI public index

description: |
  Release library artifacts to the Test PyPI public index. Use the
  ``PYANSYS_PYPI_TEST_PAT`` as the token. Artifacts get downloaded from the
  CI/CD pipeline and are assumed to be named ``<library-name>-artifacts``. This
  file is expected to contain a wheel file and a source distribution file for
  the desired library.

  .. attention::

      Starting with version ``ansys-actions@v9``, the ``use-trusted-publisher``
      input parameter is deprecated. Refer to the
      :ref:`release_pypi_trusted_publisher` if you wish to use this security
      feature.

inputs:

  # Required inputs

  library-name:
    description: |
      Name of the Python library to be published.
    required: true
    type: string

  # Optional inputs

  twine-username:
    description: |
      User name used when uploading to the public Test PyPI index.
    required: false
    default: '__token__'
    type: string

  twine-token:
    description: |
      Password used when uploading to the public Test PyPI index.
    required: false

  use-trusted-publisher:
    description: |
      Whether to use the OIDC token for releasing. Default value is ``false``.
      This is useful when you want to publish to PyPI through a CI/CD pipeline
      as a Trusted Publisher. It is necessary that your repository has been authorized
      to use Trusted Publisher's. For more information, see
      `Using a Trusted Publisher <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_.

      .. note::

          ``permissions: id-token: write`` is mandatory for trusted publishing.

    required: false
    default: false
    type: boolean

  dry-run:
    description: |
      Whether to run or not this action in testing mode. Testing mode executes
      all the action steps except the releasing artifacts one. This allows
      developers to verify the health of the action once integrated in their
      CI/CD pipelines without actually publishing artifacts. Default value is
      ``false``.
    required: false
    default: false
    type: boolean
