description: |
  This action evaluates the code quality of your project by using `pre-commit
  <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/>`_. The action installs and runs
  ``pre-commit``. It is assumed that your project contains a
  ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file in the root directory. The action can also
  be extended to lint docker files that are contained in the docker directory
  and the .devcontainer directory.

  .. warning::

    If docker lint is enabled and directories docker or .devcontainer exist,
    the action will fail if it doesn't find a Dockerfile.
