  "Check library and third-party vulnerabilities."

description: |
  Action actively checking for library and third party vulnerabilities by
  means of the `bandit <https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
  `safety <https://pyup.io/safety/>`_ Python packages. These packages
  allow you to identify security issues and vulnerabilities inside your code.

  This action has two running modes:

  - **Default mode**: when running on default mode, if a security advisory
    is detected, this action will publish both the security advisory and
    an issue so that end users are informed about existing issues.

  - **Development mode**: repository maintainers are asked to activate
    the ``dev-mode`` option, which will activate both ``dry-run`` and
    ``exit-with-error-on-new-advisory`` (independently of other configurations
    provided). This way developers are informed of potential vulnerabilities
    being introduced by them on their feature branch (while no new advisories
    are created).


  The following list of `safety`_ vulnerabilities are accepted:

  .. card:: :octicon:`codescan-checkmark` Accepted safety vulnerabilities

      .. jinja:: check-vulnerabilities

          {% for v_id in ignored_safety %}
          {% if v_id != '' %}
          - `Vulnerability {{ v_id }} <https://pyup.io/v/{{ v_id }}/f17>`_
          {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
