  Release PyPI action

description: >
  Release library artifacts to the desired PyPI index. If a private index is
  used, a ``token`` is required to publish the artifacts. Artifacts are
  downloaded from the CI/CD pipeline and are assumed to be named
  ``<library-name>-artifacts``. This file is expected to contain a wheel and a
  source distribution file for the desired library.

  dry-run:
    description: >
      Whether to run or not this action in testing mode. Testing mode executes

      CI/CD pipelines without actually publishing artifacts.
