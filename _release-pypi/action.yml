  Release PyPI action

description: >
  Release library artifacts to the desired PyPI index. If a private index is
  used, a ``token`` is required to publish the artifacts. Artifacts are
  downloaded from the CI/CD pipeline and are assumed to be named
  ``<library-name>-artifacts``. This file is expected to contain a wheel and a
  source distribution file for the desired library.

inputs:

  # Required inputs

  library-name:
    description: >
      Name of the Python library to be published.
    required: true
    type: string

  index-name:
    description: >
      The name of the index endpoint used for uploading the artifacts.
    required: true
    type: string

  twine-username:
    description: >
      User name used when uploading the artifacts to the desired PyPI index.
    required: true
    type: string

  twine-token:
    description: >
      Password used when uploading the artifacts to the desired PyPI index.
    required: true
    type: string

  python-version:
    description: >
      Python version for installing and using `twine
      <https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
    required: true
    type: string

  dry-run:
    description: >
      Whether to run or not this action in testing mode. Testing mode executes
      all the action steps except the releasing artifacts one. This allows
      developers to verify the health of the action once integrated in their
      CI/CD pipelines without actually publishing artifacts.
    required: true
    type: boolean

  skip-existing:
    description: >
      Continue uploading files if one already exists. Only valid when uploading
      to PyPI. Other implementations may not support this.
