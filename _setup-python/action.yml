inputs:
  python-version:
    description: 'Desired Python version'
    required: true
    type: string
  use-cache:

      Whether to prune uv cache or not. This input only has an effect if
      ``provision-uv`` is set to ``true``. If ``true``, the cache is pruned. If ``false``,
      the cache is not pruned. By default it is set to ``true``.

      .. note::

        When uv cache is pruned, pre-built wheels are removed but wheels built from source
        are retained.

    # NOTE: When a workflow is triggered without using the cache, it can lead to a failure
    # in the Post Run action saying that the cache folder doesn't exist on disk.
    # This is related to our use of uv to install packages, see https://github.com/ansys/actions/pull/811
