  Release to PyPI private index action

description: >
  Release library artifacts to the PyAnsys private index. Use the
  ``PYANSYS_PRIVATE_PYPI_TOKEN`` as the token. Artifacts get downloaded from the
  CI/CD pipeline and are assumed to be named ``<library-name>-artifacts``. This
  file is expected to contain a wheel and a source distribution file for the
  desired library.
