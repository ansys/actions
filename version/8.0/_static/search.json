If you are a repository maintainer and you want to\nrelease to PyPI as a trusted publisher, follow these steps:\nContact the PyAnsys Core Team to request your project\nto be added to the list of authorized repositories to release as a trusted publisher.\n(Optional) Create a dedicated release environment on your GitHub repository. This step is\noptional, but it is strongly encouraged. To create a new environment, go to the\nEnvironments\ndocumentation. Contact the PyAnsys Core Team in case of doubts.\nAdapt your release section in your workflow as follows:\nrelease:\n  name: Release project\n  if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.ref, 'refs/tags') }}\n  needs: [package]\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  # Specifying a GitHub environment is optional, but strongly encouraged\n  environment: release\n  permissions:\n    id-token: write\n    contents: write\n  steps:\n    - name: Release to the public PyPI repository\n      uses: ansys/actions/release-pypi-public@v6\n      with:\n        library-name: ${{ env.PACKAGE_NAME }}\n        use-trusted-publisher: true\n\n    - name: Release to GitHub\n      uses: ansys/actions/release-github@v6\n      with:\n        library-name: ${{ env.PACKAGE_NAME }}"
