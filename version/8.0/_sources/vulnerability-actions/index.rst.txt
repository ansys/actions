Vulnerability actions
=====================

Vulnerability actions verify that any safety advisories detected in a Python
library are properly identified and reported, both on the library itself
and third-party libraries (that is, dependencies).

Check vulnerabilities action
----------------------------

.. note::

   Users can try out the ``ansys/check-vulnerabilities`` action on their local repository
   by doing the following:

   #. Download the ``check_vulnerabilities.py`` script and the ``requirements.txt`` file from
      the `ansys/check-vulnerabilities action folder <https://github.com/ansys/actions/tree/main/check-vulnerabilities>`_.
   #. Move the downloaded files to the root of the repository.
   #. Create a virtual environment by running ``python -m venv .venv``.
   #. Activate the virtual environment.
   #. Install the required dependencies by running ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
   #. Install your repository with the command ``pip install -e .``.
   #. Define the following environment variables:

      - ``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_TOKEN``: A GitHub token with the necessary permissions to access security advisories on the repository you are interested in.
      - ``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_PACKAGE_NAME``: The Python package name of your repository. This is the name of the package that you would use in a ``pip install`` command.
      - ``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_REPOSITORY``: The full name of the repository you are interested in. This is the name of the repository in the format ``<owner>/<repository>``.

   #. Run the script by running ``python check_vulnerabilities.py --run-local``.

.. warning::

   The ``ansys/check-vulnerabilities`` action needs to be performed on a public repository.
   If the repository is private, the action will fail due to denied access.
