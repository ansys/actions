Specifically, the default vocabularies path should be modified from\nVocab/ANSYS to config/vocabularies/ANSYS. This adjustment ensures that Vale can locate the required vocabulary files.\n\nUpdate .gitignore\n\nIf your repository has .gitignore files under styles folder, please update them according to vocabularies changes\n\nTurn off Vale.Terms\n\nLocate the section in your doc/.vale.ini file where styles are applied.\nAdd Vale.Terms = NO under the section where styles are applied, typically marked with [*.{rst}].\n\nUpdate codespell hook\n\nIf your repository includes a codespell hook in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file,\nutilizing the accept.txt file, it necessitates modification to reflect the new path\nas provided below.\n\nFinally, verify that the doc-style action is functioning correctly with the latest changes applied.\nRun the action and ensure that the documentation style checks are performed without any issues."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"migrations/index.html#migration-guide","title":"Migration guide","text":"Migration guide\n\nThis guide provides information on new features, breaking changes, how to migrate\nfrom one version of the actions to another, and other upstream dependencies that\nhave been updated."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"migrations/index.html#version-v102","title":"Migration guide > Version v10.2","text":"Version v10.2\n\nNew Features:\n\nBuild-Library Changes: The build-library action now includes two new inputs:\n\ncheckout-fetch-depth (default: 1): Allows configuring the fetch depth when checking out the repository.\nSetting this to 0 fetches the entire history, which may be necessary for certain build processes that\nrely on full commit history.\n\ncheckout-fetch-tags (default: false): When set to true, this input enables fetching all tags from the repository.\nThis is useful for build processes that depend on tag information.\n\nChangelog Action Changes: The doc-changelog action input use-conventional-commits has been renamed to use-pull-request-title for clarity.\nIf you use the old input, a deprecation warning appears.\n\nPR Documentation Deployment: The doc-deploy-pr action is now easier to use.

Furthermore, only patch pre-release are supported, meaning the PEP 440 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/>\ncompliant version identifiers are limited to those that comply with the following scheme:\n\nIn the same pre-release cycle, documentation is retained for a maximum of three pre-release versions and removed following a normal release.\n\nAdded a checkout option (default: true) to build-library, check-actions-security, and code-style actions. Setting checkout\nto false allows reuse of the workspace from a prior step without modification.\n\nIntroduced an upload-artifact-name-prefix option (default: documentation) in the doc-build action, enabling customization of uploaded\ndocumentation artifact names. This also allows distinct documentation artifacts to be uploaded for separate documentation build jobs within the\nsame workflow.\n\nMigration Steps:\n\nFor Poetry-based projects, ensure that you provide the correct values for optional-dependencies-name (default: doc) and group-dependencies-name.\n\noptional-dependencies-name: Refers to the extras defined in the pyproject.toml file.\n\ngroup-dependencies-name: Refers to the dependency groups defined in the same file.\n\nIf your documentation dependencies are defined as extras, changes to your workflow are likely not needed since the default value for optional-dependencies-name\nwill target the doc extra. However, using dependency groups (as is the case with most PyAnsys libraries) requires the following update to your workflow:\n\nBefore\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"migrations/index.html#version-v10","title":"Migration guide > Version v10","text":"Version v10\n\nNew Features:\n\nWorkflow Security Audits: Introduced ansys/action/check-actions-security to audit workflow files\nfor security and vulnerability issues. Provides summary and detailed reports using the\nzizmor static analysis tool. See zizmor audit rules\nfor information about detected issues and their remediation.\n\nPR Documentation Deployment: Added ansys/action/doc-deploy-pr to deploy HTML documentation\nfor pull requests at https://<cname>/pull/<pr-number>/. Documentation is automatically removed\nwhen the pull request is closed. Refer to docs-deploy-pr-setup for setup details.\n\nFaster Package Installation: Added a use-uv option (default: true) to build-library,\nbuild-wheelhouse, check-licenses, check-vulnerabilities, code-style, doc-build,\ndoc-changelog, doc-deply-changelog, hk-package-clean-except, hk-package-clean-untagged,\nrelease-github, and tests-pytest actions. This leverages uv for faster package installation,\nimproving workflow speed for projects with multiple dependencies.\n\nAbout pre-releases and extra indices\n\nThe installation of pre-releases by uv is only supported if these are\nlisted in the pyproject.toml file. If you wish to install\npre-releases at all levels, you must set the UV_PRERELEASE=allow\nenvironment variable.\n\nRegarding extra indices, uv supports the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL for\nspecifying extra indices. This is the equivalent to the\nPIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.\n\nDependency Groups Support: doc-build and tests-pytest actions now support\nPEP 735 dependency groups via the group-dependencies-name\ninput. Extras remain supported through the optional-dependencies-name input.\n\nSBOM Generation: build-wheelhouse action now generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in\nSPDX format and uploads it as an artifact. This SBOM is generated using Syft.\nNote that the SBOM artifacts are now included in the Github release.\n\nBreaking Changes:\n\nPython Version Support: Dropped support for Python versions below 3.9.\n\nJSON Builder Removal: ansys/actions/doc-build no longer supports the JSON builder\nfor documentation rendering.\n\nDependency Groups Parsing: Replaced the toml library with tomli in doc-style,\ndoc-changelog, and release-github actions due to improved support for pyproject.toml\nfiles with nested dependency groups. The tomli-version input replaces the former\ntoml-version input.\n\nBuild-Wheelhouse Changes:  the build-wheelhouse action now installs packages in a virtual environment\ninstead of at the system level. If you have subsequent workflow steps (e.g., running smoke tests) that depend on\nthese packages, activate the virtual environment using the action’s activate-venv output. For example:"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"migrations/index.html#version-v90","title":"Migration guide > Version v9.0","text":"Version v9.0\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nUse ansys/actions/check-licenses actions with Python version 3.10 or higher.\n\nTo use check-licenses: true with the ansys/actions/build-wheelhouse action, use Python version 3.10 or higher.\n\nUpdate your workflow to not use use-trusted-publisher: true with our pypi release actions.\n\nUsing the trusted publisher approach in ansys/release-pypi-public and ansys/release-pypi-private actions is\nnot possible anymore. The reason for that is related to the action\npypa/gh-action-pypi-publish which allows to use the trusted\npublisher. Indeed, it is no longer possible to use the action in a composite action for versions after v1.12.0, see\npypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1.12.0.\nHowever, the latest versions of this action is required to upload\nPEP 639 licensing metadata\nto PyPI. This allows to avoid adding upper bounds on build system like setuptools<=67.0.0, wheel<0.46.0 or\nflit_core>=3.2,<3.11.\n\nMigration Steps:\n\nUpdate input python-version to 3.10 or higher in the ansys/actions/check-licenses action or in\nthe ansys/actions/build-wheelhouse action if you are using the check-licenses input.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen using trusted publisher to publish to PyPI, define you own release job instead of using the\nansys/actions/release-pypi-* actions.

This action allows maintainers to auto-approve and merge\ndependabot PRs and pre-commit.ci PRs. It is recommended to add the action at the end of the workflow, once all the\nstages have finished successfully. That way, in case a repository has failing stages, it is not run. This action will run in case\nthe PR has been created by dependabot or pre-commit.ci. You can see an example of its implementation\nhere\nand the associated PR/commit.\n\nAdded a new input parameter use-ansys-default-template to the ansys/actions/doc-changelog action.\nThis input allows users to utilize the default template provided by the ansys/actions repository.\nFor migration instructions, see the migration steps below.\n\nThe default template is only available for the ansys/actions/doc-changelog action and is in the reStructuredText (rst) format.\n\nAdded a new input parameter fail-level to the ansys/actions/doc-style action.\nThis input allows users to select the report level used to control check results.\nDefault value is \"error\" but it can be changed to \"any\", \"info\", \"warning\", or \"error\".\n\nThe release-github/action.yml action has been improved with the ability to extend a Github release note with\ninstructions on how to verify the release’s artifacts attestations with\nGithub’s command-line tool.\n\nAdded a new input attest-provenance to the ansys/actions/build-library and ansys/actions/build-wheelhouse\nactions. Note that adding provenance attestations requires write permissions for id-token and attestation.\nFor example:\n\nAdded two inputs to the release-github/action.yml action. The first input parameter\nadd-artifact-attestation-notes allows users to add artifact attestation notes to the Github release notes.\nThe second input parameter generate_release_notes allows users to deactivate the notes automatically generated\nby default.\n\nAdded a new input parameter randomize to the ansys/actions/tests-pytest action to randomize the order of the tests.\n\nMigration Steps:\n\nThe default documentation includes tabs and tab items, providing a clean changelog reStructuredText (rst) file.
