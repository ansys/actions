  Build library action

description: |
  Verifies if a Python library builds properly. As a result of a successful
  building process, wheel and source distribution artifacts are generated. This
  action is expected to be used as an independent job.

  .. note::

      Use this action instead of the `build-ci-wheels
      <https://actions.docs.ansys.com/stable/doc-actions/index.html#build-ci-wheels-action>`_
      if your library is a pure Python project with no source code to be compiled.

inputs:

  # Required inputs

  library-name:
    description: >
      Name of the Python library. This is the name used when uploading the wheel
      and source distribution as artifacts. The name should be the same one used
      in the PyPI index.
    required: true
    type: string

  # Optional inputs

  python-version:
    description: >
      Python version used for installing and running ``pre-commit``.

    required: false
    type: string

  use-python-cache:
    description: >
      Whether to use the Python cache for installing previously downloaded
      libraries. If ``true``, previously downloaded libraries are installed from the
      Python cache. If ``false``, libraries are downloaded from the PyPI index.
