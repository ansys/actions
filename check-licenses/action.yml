  Check licenses action

description: |
  Verifies if the licenses of the dependencies installed in the current
  environment are compliant with PyAnsys guidelines. This action is assumed to
  be used in its own job step. It clones the project and installs the project with
  its runtime dependencies.

  .. note::

     **This action relies on PyPI metadata to identify the license for each package.**

      If the metadata are flawed or not included, it may lead to
      inconclusive results. In those cases, please perform a thorough review of the
      package you are using. Additionally, it is advised not to blindly rely on PyPI metadata.
      Even though packages may define their license as of a certain type, the
      package could be not applying properly its licensing conditions.

  .. admonition:: Projects requiring additional licenses or packages

      If a certain project requires a license or package that is not supported,
      `open an issue <https://github.com/ansys/actions/issues>`_ in the
      `official ansys/actions repository
      <https://github.com/ansys/actions>`_. For additional support, please
      contact the `PyAnsys support <mailto:support@pyansys.com>`_.
