  Release to GitHub action

description: |
    Release library artifacts to the GitHub release section. Some minimum
    artifacts are required before running this action. These artifacts include
    ``documentation-html``, ``documentation-pdf``, and
    ``<library-name>-artifacts`` files. This last file must contain the wheels and
    source distribution files of the library.

    If you are using the ``title_format`` and ``issue_format`` from the ``doc-changelog`` action
    setup guide, https://actions.docs.ansys.com/version/dev/migrations/docs-changelog-setup.html,
    the changelog for your release is included in the release notes on GitHub.
