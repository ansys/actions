  Release to PyPI public index action

description: >
  Release library artifacts to the PyPI public index. Use the ``PYPI_TOKEN`` as
  the token. Artifacts get downloaded from the CI/CD pipeline and are assumed to be
  named ``<library-name>-artifacts``. This file is expected to contain a wheel file
  and a source distribution file for the desired library.

      Whether to run or not this action in testing mode. Testing mode executes
