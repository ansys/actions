name: Check Environment Approval

description: |
  Evaluates the pull request workflow and determines the environment name to be
  used in the workflow. The environment name should then be used in a workflow
  to trigger a manual approval step if needed.

  The environment name is set to the ``manual-check-environment`` input if
  the workflow is triggered by ``dependabot[bot]`` or if the pull request was
  created by ``dependabot[bot]`` and ``pyansys-ci-bot`` is the actor triggering
  the workflow. Otherwise, it is set to ``skip-manual-check-environment`` input.

  The manual check is required to mitigate supply chain attacks, where a malicious
  dependency update could execute arbitrary code in our build environment.
  Dependabot PRs must be reviewed carefully and approved manually before
  running the CI.

  .. note::

    This action relies on the
    `github context <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs#github-context>`_
    to determine which environment to use. The manual approval is added by configuring a
    `github environment <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#about-environments>`_
    requesting manual approval and using it in the workflow.
