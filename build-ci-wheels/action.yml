  Build CI wheels

description: |
  Build wheels for a Python library containing compiled source code. This action
  is expected to be used within a matrix job. Its goal is to generate wheel
  files for every combination of operating system, build system, and Python
  version. The action uses the `cibuildwheel
  <https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel>`_ behind the scenes.

  .. note::

      This actions should only be used by libraries including source code that
      needs to be compiled.

inputs:

  # Required inputs

  python-version:
    description: |
      Python version used for building the wheels.
    required: true
    type: string

  library-name:
    description: |
      Name of the Python library. This is the name used when uploading the wheel
      and source distribution as artifacts. The name should be the same one used
      in the PyPI index.
    required: true
    type: string

  operating-system:
    description: |
      Name of the operating system where the library is installed.
    required: true
    type: string

  # Optional inputs

  cibw-build:
    description: |
      Desired build wheel CPython version.
    default: 'cp310-*'
    required: false
    type: string

  cibw-archs:
    description: |
      Desired build architecture.
    default: "auto"
    required: false
    type: string

  requires-pypy:
      description: |
        Whether to generate wheels for wheel files for `PyPy
        <https://www.pypy.org/>`_ in addition to the wheel files for CPython.
        Default value is ``false``.
