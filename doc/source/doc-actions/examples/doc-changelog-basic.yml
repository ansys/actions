# Add these lines to .github/workflows/label.yml so the changelog fragment
# is updated when the PR is labeled & the title changes:
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     # opened, reopened, and synchronize are default for pull_request
#     # edited - when PR title or body is changed
#     # labeled - when labels are added to PR
#     types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, edited, labeled]

# Put changelog-fragment action in .github/workflows/label.yml
# Don't forget to add pyansys-ci-bot as a member of your repository
