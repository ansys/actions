# The same action takes care of both deployment and cleanup of PR documentation
# Add these lines to your pull request workflow file to also trigger
# the action when the PR is closed to ensure documentation cleanup:
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     # opened, reopened, and synchronize are default for pull_request
#     # closed - when the PR is closed (via merge or otherwise)
#     types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, edited, labeled]

# Add a condition to skip other jobs in the workflow when the PR is closed
# For example, for the doc-build job which must be run before the PR can be deployed,
# but doesn't need to run for cleaning up the PR documentation:

# doc-build:
#   name: "Doc build"
#   # Skip when the PR is closed
#   if: github.event.action != 'closed'
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#   steps:
#     - uses: ansys/actions/doc-build@{{ version }}
#       with:
#         python-version: ${{ '{{env.MAIN_PYTHON_VERSION}}' }}

doc-deploy-pr:
  name: "Deploy PR documentation"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: doc-build
  # Run when the PR is closed i.e. when doc-build job is skipped
  if: ${{ '{{ always() }}' }} && (needs.doc-build.result == 'success' || needs.doc-build.result == 'skipped')
  steps:
    - uses: ansys/actions/doc-deploy-pr@{{ version }}
      with:
        cname: ${{ '{{ env.DOCUMENTATION_CNAME }}' }}
        token: ${{ '{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' }}
        bot-user: ${{ '{{ secrets.PYANSYS_CI_BOT_USERNAME }}' }}
